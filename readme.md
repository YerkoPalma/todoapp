> menubar todo app

![demo-dsh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5105812/58754430-b0a75900-849d-11e9-885a-efe42f4e8213.gif)

There are tons of Todo Apps out there, but:

- Most of them are too fancy.
- Most of them are web or mobile based, but I work mostly on my desktop.

So, I guess this is different because:

- As a menubar app, you don't need to have another app opened
- Really easy to access
- Very minimal, I need a todo app not a Gantt nor Kanban project.
